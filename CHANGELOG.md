[View diff](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/Enhanced-Monsters/compare/1.3.1..1.3.2)
- Fixed custom rotations not setting correctly, and splitted *On Floor Rotation* and *In Hand Rotation* in the config.
- Temporarily suspended the custom sounds feature, it will only use the default sounds now.
- Added possibility to set `default` for default sound, or `none` for no sound at all in all the sound configs.
- Added a custom dead enemy item inventory icon, designed by **Dededenied**.
- Added a new setting to set the grab collision box size.

> Note: This update deprecates old configs. Make sure to port your changes from `OLD_EnemiesData.json`.

[View diff](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/Enhanced-Monsters/compare/1.3.0..1.3.1)
- Added a config backup system: Deprecated config versions are renamed to `OLD_EnemyData.json` in order to not screw all your modifications on each new version. All you have to do is port your changes to the newer versions of the config.
- Fixed the mod not loading correctly due to the custom sounds loading attempt even if there was none provided.

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/Enhanced-Monsters/releases/tag/1.3.0) - 2025-02-02

[View diff](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/Enhanced-Monsters/compare/1.2.1..1.3.0)
- Added new enemies metadata configs:
	- `TwoHanded`: Wether the body makes "hand fulls" or not
	- `GrabSFX`: Allows you to use a custom sound as the body grab SFX
	- `DropSFX`: Allows you to use a custom sound as the body drop SFX
	- `PocketSFX`: Allows you to use a custom sound as the body pocketed SFX (only for bodies that aren't TwoHanded)
- Added mob icon in inventory (instead of the white cube). This is meant to change, I'm looking for an artist to make a custom inventory icon.
- Added a body drop sound, made by **Moroxide** *(Lethal Resonance contributor)*
- Added a custom sound import system for mobs drops. More details on how to use in the `README.md`.
- Fixed some mobs not having their rank shown *when still alive*.

- Fixed some mobs having invalid animations or broken animations when they died.

[View diff](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/Enhanced-Monsters/compare/1.1.3..1.1.4)

- Added a parameter on wether to play or not some mobs death animation. Turning this setting off on some monsters might fix some mobs to be invisible after their death animation.

- Added foundation of the next major update "Enemies Loots", will be implemented once the enemies scrap data is fully stable or at least in a satisfying state.

Known issues:
- Sometimes, dead bodies appear next to the ship after landing on a new moon, I don't know why it happens.

[View diff](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/Enhanced-Monsters/compare/1.1.0..1.1.1)
- Fixed that some mobs wouldn't register their scrap self because I was not searching for ScanNode correctly inside of them, leading into some mobs could be killed but no corpse scrap was spawning
- Fixed external mod `EnemyDataRegister` function: It should now be callable from `BaseUnityPlugin.Awake()` and `.Start()`.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/Enhanced-Monsters/releases/tag/1.1.0) - 2025-01-16

[View diff](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/Enhanced-Monsters/compare/1.0.5..1.1.0)
- Removed Xilo's StaticNetcode library for a proper networking.
- Made LethalConfig an optional mod, it is no longer required, but the config mod will still be correctly implemented by Enhanced Monsters
- Added support for LethalSettings, so users won't need to add yet another config mod if they didn't need one or another before.
- Added a button in both configs to easily copy the path to `EnemyData.json` configuration file. All you need is to paste it inside the File Explorer.
- Added a toggle to disable Ranks synchronization, so users can have their own ranking on their side. This setting is disabled by default.
- **Fixed desynchronization issues with the dead bodies that occurred when any player that is not the host picked up a dead monster**
- **Fixed desynchronization that were occasionally occurring when killing a monster.**
- **Reworked entirely the way enemy scraps were generated.** They are now more consistent thanks to a custom GrabbableObject component.
- There should be less errors in the console due to Enhanced Monsters, and there should be no error while in-game.
- Fixed settings names not showing correctly in LethalConfig.
